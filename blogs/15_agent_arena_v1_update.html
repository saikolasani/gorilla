                        Since its release, the Agent Arena has gathered over <strong>500 new user-submitted
                            ratings</strong>, bringing our total to an impressive <strong>2,671 pairwise
                            comparisons</strong>. This growth marks a significant milestone üéâ, enabling the publication
                        of a <strong>new dataset of battle results</strong> alongside an updated Elo-based rating system
                        for evaluating agents.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">
                        As part of this update, we are introducing an interactive notebook to help users explore these
                        ratings and uncover deeper insights into our evolving rankings. You can access the new battle
                        dataset and the Elo calculation notebook here:

                        and their subcomponents consistently outperform others. By analyzing the updated battle data, we
                        uncover critical insights across several dimensions:

A runaway version of the greenhouse effect can be defined by a limit on a planet's outgoing longwave radiation which is asymptotically reached due to higher surface temperatures evaporating water into the atmosphere, increasing its optical depth. This positive feedback means the planet cannot cool down through longwave radiation (via the Stefan\u2013Boltzmann law) and continues to heat up until it can radiate outside of the absorption bands of the water vapour.The runaway greenhouse effect is often formulated with water vapour as the condensable species. The water vapour reaches the stratosphere and escapes into space via hydrodynamic escape, resulting in a desiccated planet. This likely happened in the early history of Venus.Research in 2012 found that almost all lines of evidence indicate that it is unlikely to be possible to trigger a full runaway greenhouse on Earth by adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. However, the authors cautioned that \"our understanding of the dynamics, thermodynamics, radiative transfer and cloud physics of hot and steamy atmospheres is weak\", and that we \"cannot therefore completely rule out the possibility that human actions might cause a transition, if not to full runaway, then at least to a much warmer climate state than the present one\". A runaway greenhouse effect similar to Venus appears to have virtually no chance of being caused by people. A 2013 article concluded that runaway greenhouse \"could in theory be triggered by increased greenhouse forcing\", but that \"anthropogenic emissions are probably insufficient\". Venus-like conditions on Earth require a large long-term forcing that is unlikely to occur until the sun brightens by some tens of percents, which will take a few billion years. Earth is expected to experience a runaway greenhouse effect \"in about 2 billion years as solar luminosity increases\".Page: Greenhouse effectSummary: The greenhouse effect occurs when greenhouse gases in a planet's atmosphere insulate the planet from losing heat to space, raising its surface temperature. Surface heating can happen from an internal heat source as in the case of Jupiter, or from its host star as in the case of the Earth. In the case of Earth, the Sun emits shortwave radiation (sunlight) that passes through greenhouse gases to heat the Earth's surface. In response, the Earth's surface emits longwave radiation that is mostly absorbed by greenhouse gases. The absorption of longwave radiation prevents it from reaching space, reducing the rate at which the Earth can cool off.Without the greenhouse effect, the Earth's average surface temperature would be about \u221218 \u00b0C (\u22120.4 \u00b0F), compared to the 20th century average of about 14 \u00b0C (57 \u00b0F), or a more recent average of about 15 \u00b0C (59 \u00b0F). In addition to naturally present greenhouse gases, burning of fossil fuels has increased amounts of carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere. As a result, global warming of about 1.2 \u00b0C (2.2 \u00b0F) has occurred since the Industrial Revolution, with the global average surface temperature increasing at a rate of 0.18 \u00b0C (0.32 \u00b0F) per decade since 1981.All objects with a temperature above absolute zero emit thermal radiation. The wavelengths of thermal radiation emitted by the Sun and Earth differ because their surface temperatures are different. The Sun has a surface temperature of 5,500 \u00b0C (9,900 \u00b0F), so it emits most of its energy as shortwave radiation in near-infrared and visible wavelengths (as sunlight). In contrast, Earth's surface has a much lower temperature, so it emits longwave radiation at mid- and far-infrared wavelengths. A gas is a greenhouse gas if it absorbs longwave radiation. Earth's atmosphere absorbs only 23% Thought:Thought: I now have a better understanding of the greenhouse effect and its relationship with climate change. The greenhouse effect occurs when greenhouse gases in the atmosphere insulate the planet from losing heat to space, raising its surface temperature. Human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, have increased the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, leading to global warming.Action: wikipediaAction Input: Greenhouse gases and climate changeObservation: Page: Climate change mitigationSummary: Climate change mitigation (or decarbonisation) is action to limit the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere that cause climate change. Climate change mitigation actions include conserving energy and replacing fossil fuels with clean energy sources. Secondary mitigation strategies include changes to land use and removing carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere. Current climate change mitigation policies are insufficient as they would still result in global warming of about 2.7 \u00b0C by 2100, significantly above the 2015 Paris Agreement's goal of limiting global warming to below 2 \u00b0C.  Solar energy and wind power can replace fossil fuels at the lowest cost compared to other renewable energy options. The availability of sunshine and wind is variable and can require electrical grid upgrades, such as using long-distance electricity transmission to group a range of power sources. Energy storage can also be used to even out power output, and demand management can limit power use when power generation is low. Cleanly generated electricity can usually replace fossil fuels for powering transportation, heating buildings, and running industrial processes. Certain processes are more difficult to decarbonise, such as air travel and cement production. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) can be an option to reduce net emissions in these circumstances, although fossil fuel power plants with CCS technology is currently a high cost climate change mitigation strategy.Human land use changes such as agriculture and deforestation cause about 1/4th of climate change. These changes impact how much CO2 is absorbed by plant matter and how much organic matter decays or burns to release CO2. These changes are part of the fast carbon cycle, whereas fossil fuels release CO2 that was buried underground as part of the slow carbon cycle. Methane is a short lived greenhouse gas that is produced by decaying organic matter and livestock, as well as fossil fuel extraction. Land use changes can also impact precipitation patterns and the reflectivity of the surface of the Earth. It is possible to cut emissions from agriculture by reducing food waste, switching to a more plant-based diet (also referred to as low-carbon diet), and by improving farming processes.Various policies can encourage climate change mitigation. Carbon pricing systems have been set up that either tax CO2 emissions or cap total emissions and trade emission credits. Fossil fuel subsidies can be eliminated in favor of clean energy subsidies, and incentives offered for installing energy efficiency measures or switching to electric power sources. Another issue is overcoming environmental objections when constructing new clean energy sources and making grid modifications.Page: Climate changeSummary: In common usage, climate change describes global warming\u2014the ongoing increase in global average temperature\u2014and its effects on Earth's climate system. Climate change in a broader sense also includes previous long-term changes to Earth's climate. The current rise in global average temperature is primarily caused by humans burning fossil fuels since the Industrial Revolution. Fossil fuel use, deforestation, and some agricultural and industrial practices add to greenhouse gases. These gases absorb some of the heat that the Earth radiates after it warms from sunlight, warming the lower atmosphere. Carbon dioxide, the primary greenhouse gas driving global warming, has grown by about 50% and is at levels unseen for millions of years.Climate change has an increasingly large impact on the environment. Deserts are expanding, while heat waves and wildfires are becoming more common. Amplified warming in the Arctic has contributed to thawing permafrost, retreat of glaciers and sea ice decline. Higher temperatures are also causing more intense storms, droughts, and other weather extremes. Rapid environmental change in mountains, coral reefs, and the Arctic is forcing many speciesThought:Thought: I now have a better understanding of the greenhouse effect and its relationship with climate change.

Higher temperatures are also causing more intense storms, droughts, and other weather extremes. Rapid environmental change in mountains, coral reefs, and the Arctic is forcing many species to relocate or become extinct. Even if efforts to minimize future warming are successful, some effects will continue for centuries. These include ocean heating, ocean acidification and sea level rise.Climate change threatens people with increased flooding, extreme heat, increased food and water scarcity, more disease, and economic loss. Human migration and conflict can also be a result. The World Health Organization calls climate change one of the biggest threats to global health in the 21st century. Societies and ecosystems will experience more severe risks without action to limit warming. Adapting to climate change through efforts like flood control measures or drought-resistant crops partially reduces climate change risks, although some limits to adaptation have already been reached. Poorer communities are responsible for a small share of global emissions, yet have the least ability to adapt and are most vulnerable to climate change.Many climate change impacts have been felt in recent years, with 2023 the warmest on record at +1.48 \u00b0C (2.66 \u00b0F) since regular tracking began in 1850. Additional warming will increase these impacts and can trigger tipping points, such as melting all of the Greenland ice sheet. Under the 2015 Paris Agreement, nations collectively agreed to keep warming \"well under 2 \u00b0C\". However, with pledges made under the Agreement, global warming would still reach about 2.7 \u00b0C (4.9 \u00b0F) by the end of the century. Limiting warming to 1.5 \u00b0C would require halving emissions by 2030 and achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.Fossil fuel use can be phased out by conserving energy and switching to energy sources that do not produce significant carbon pollution. These energy sources include wind, solar, hydro, and nuclear power. Cleanly generated electricity can replace fossil fuels for powering transportation, heating buildings, and running industrial processes. Carbon can also be removed from the atmosphere, for instance by increasing forest cover and farming with methods that capture carbon in soil.Page: History of climate change scienceSummary: The history of the scientific discovery of climate change began in the early 19th century when ice ages and other natural changes in paleoclimate were first suspected and the natural greenhouse effect was first identified. In the late 19th century, scientists first argued that human emissions of greenhouse gases could change Earth's energy balance and climate. The existence of the greenhouse effect, while not named as such, was proposed as early as 1824 by Joseph Fourier. The argument and the evidence were further strengthened by Claude Pouillet in 1827 and 1838. In 1856 Eunice Newton Foote demonstrated that the warming effect of the sun is greater for air with water vapour Thought:Thought: I now know the final answerFinal Answer: The greenhouse effect contributes to climate change by trapping heat in the atmosphere, leading to an increase in global average temperature. Human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, have increased the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, leading to global warming. The greenhouse effect is a natural process that occurs when greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, absorb longwave radiation from the Earth's surface and atmosphere, preventing it from escaping into space. This process is essential for life on Earth, as it keeps the planet warm enough to support life. However, human activities have increased the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, leading to an enhancement of the natural greenhouse effect and an increase in global temperatures. Climate change has severe impacts on the environment, including rising sea levels, more frequent natural disasters, and changes in weather patterns. To mitigate climate change, it is essential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by transitioning to renewable energy sources, increasing energy efficiency, and implementing policies to limit emissions.> The greenhouse effect contributes to climate change by trapping heat in the atmosphere, leading to an increase in global average temperature.

                    <strong>Outcome:</strong> üåç In this comparison, Agent B (llama-3.1-70B-instruct with Wikipedia)
                    provided a more comprehensive and scientifically accurate explanation of the greenhouse effect and
                    climate change. While Agent A (gemini-1.5-pro with Google Serper) delivered a basic overview, Agent
                    B systematically covered the fundamental mechanisms, natural versus enhanced effects, and human
                    activities' impact. The response included specific technical details about radiation types,
                    greenhouse gases (CO2 and methane), and mitigation approaches. Agent B's structured explanation
                    progresses logically from basic mechanisms through to consequences and solutions. Through multiple
                    Wikipedia queries, Agent B builds a thorough, evidence-based explanation that effectively connects
                    scientific principles with real-world implications.

A PPF illustrates several economic concepts, such as allocative efficiency, economies of scale, opportunity cost (or marginal rate of transformation), productive efficiency,  and scarcity of resources (the fundamental economic problem that all societies face). This tradeoff is usually considered for an economy, but also applies to each individual, household, and economic organization. One good can only be produced by diverting resources from other goods, and so by producing less of them.The code that caused this warning is on line 389 of the file /opt/render/project/src/.venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/wikipedia/wikipedia.py.

By doing so, it defines productive efficiency in the context of that production set: a point on the frontier indicates efficient use of the available inputs (such as points B, D and C in the graph), a point beneath the curve (such as A) indicates inefficiency, and a point beyond the curve (such as X) indicates impossibility.  lis = BeautifulSoup(html).find_all('li')PPFs are normally drawn as bulging upwards or outwards from the origin (\"concave\" when viewed from the origin), but they can be represented as bulging downward (inwards) or linear (straight), depending on a number of assumptions. An outward shift of the PPC results from growth of the availability of inputs, such as physical capital or labour, or from technological progress in knowledge of how to transform inputs into outputs. Such a shift reflects, for instance, economic growth of an economy already operating at its full productivity (on the PPF), which means that more of both outputs can now be produced during the specified period of time without sacrificing the output of either good. Conversely, the PPF will shift inward if the labour force shrinks, the supply of raw materials is depleted, or a natural disaster decreases the stock of physical capital.However, most economic contractions reflect not that less can be produced but that the economy has started operating below the frontier, as typically, both labour and physical capital are underemployed, remaining therefore idle.In microeconomics, the PPF shows the options open to an individual, household, or firm in a two-good world.

                    <strong>Outcome:</strong> üìö In this comparison, Agent A (llama-3.1-70B-instruct with Wikipedia)
                    excelled by providing a comprehensive and detailed explanation of opportunity cost. It covered the
                    basic definition, its relationship to scarcity and choice, and both explicit and implicit costs.
                    Agent A also explored non-monetary aspects such as time and utility, and connected the concept to
                    the Production Possibility Frontier (PPF). This depth of information provides valuable context for
                    understanding opportunity cost within the broader economic framework. In contrast, Agent B
                    (gpt-4o-2024-08-06 with Google Serper) offers a more concise definition, lacking the depth and
                    educational value found in Agent A's response. Agent A's thorough research process, involving
                    multiple Wikipedia queries, results in a more contextualized and practical understanding of
                    opportunity cost, making it superior for users seeking a well-rounded economic perspective.

                    </strong><br />
                    Our battle outcomes reveal consistent limitations in Gemini-1.5-flash-001's performance. The model
                    tends to provide surface-level responses without diving into detailed analysis or specific evidence.
                    As seen in the musician comparison, it defaulted to listing multiple artists (Elvis, Beatles, Dylan,
                    Chuck Berry) without substantiating why any might be more influential. In the soap-making example,
                    it offered only vague instructions without crucial measurements or safety considerations. This
                    pattern of superficial engagement extends to its handling of scientific topics, as demonstrated in
                    the climate change discussion where it provided only basic mechanisms without exploring the
                    interconnected effects. The model frequently avoids making definitive statements, often concluding
                    with phrases like "it's difficult to say" rather than building well-reasoned arguments. When faced
                    with complex queries requiring synthesis of multiple data points, it struggles to integrate
                    information meaningfully or provide structured, comprehensive responses that would be practically
                    useful to users.

He is regarded as one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century. Bowie was acclaimed by critics and musicians, particularly for his innovative work during the 1970s. His career was marked by reinvention and visual presentation, and his music and stagecraft had a significant impact on popular music.\nBowie developed an interest in music from an early age. He studied art, music and design before embarking on a professional career as a musician in 1963. He released a string of unsuccessful singles with local bands and a self-titled solo album (1967) before achieving his first top-five entry on the UK Singles Chart with \"Space Oddity\" (1969). After a period of experimentation, he re-emerged in 1972 during the glam rock era with the flamboyant and androgynous alter ego Ziggy Stardust. The character was spearheaded by the success of \"Starman\" and its album The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (both 1972), which won him widespread popularity. In 1975, Bowie's style shifted towards a sound he characterised as \"plastic soul\", initially alienating many of his UK fans but garnering his first major US crossover success with the number-one single \"Fame\" and the album Young Americans (both 1975). In 1976, Bowie starred in the cult film The Man Who Fell to Earth and released Station to Station. In 1977, he again changed direction with the electronic-inflected album Low, the first of three collaborations with Brian Eno that came to be known as the Berlin Trilogy. \"Heroes\" (1977) and Lodger (1979) followed; each album reached the UK top five and received lasting critical praise.\nAfter uneven commercial success in the late 1970s, Bowie had three number-one hits: the 1980 single \"Ashes to Ashes\", its album Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps) and \"Under Pressure\" (a 1981 collaboration with Queen). He achieved his greatest commercial success in the 1980s with Let's Dance (1983). Between 1988 and 1992, he fronted the hard rock band Tin Machine before resuming his solo career in 1993. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Bowie continued to experiment with musical styles, including industrial and jungle. He also continued acting; his roles included Major Jack Celliers in Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence (1983), Jareth the Goblin King in Labyrinth (1986), Phillip Jeffries in Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me (1992), Andy Warhol in the biopic Basquiat (1996), and Nikola Tesla in The Prestige (2006), among other film and television appearances and cameos. He ceased touring after 2004 and his last live performance was at a charity event in 2006. He returned from a decade-long recording hiatus in 2013 with The Next Day and remained musically active until his death from liver cancer in 2016. He died two days after both his 69th birthday and the release of his final album, Blackstar.\nDuring his lifetime, his record sales, estimated at over 100 million worldwide, made him one of the best-selling musicians of all time. Often dubbed the \"chameleon of rock\" due to his constant musical reinventions, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996. Rolling Stone ranked him among the greatest artists in history. As of 2022, Bowie was the best-selling vinyl artist of the 21st century.\nPage: Robert Johnson\nSummary: Robert Leroy Johnson (May 8, 1911 \u2013 August 16, 1938) was an American blues musician and songwriter. His landmark recordings in 1936 and 1937 display a combination of singing, guitar skills, and songwriting talent that has influenced later generations of musicians. Although his recording career spanned only seven months, he is recognized as a master of the blues, particularly the Delta blues style, and as one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame describes him as perhaps \"the first ever rock s\nThought:Okay, based on the information from Wikipedia, it seems that the most influential musician of the 20th century was likely David Bowie. The key points are:\n- David Bowie is widely regarded as one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century, known for his innovative and genre-defying music.\n- His career spanned over 5 decades and he was acclaimed by critics and fellow musicians for his groundbreaking work, particularly in the 1970s. \n- He had a significant impact on popular music through his musical reinventions, visual presentation, and influential albums and songs.\n- In contrast, while Robert Johnson was an extremely important and influential blues artist, his recording career was much shorter (7 months) compared to Bowie's decades-long impact.\nTherefore, the final answer is:\nFinal Answer: David Bowie was the most influential musician of the 20th century. He had a decades-long career of innovative and genre-defying music that had a profound impact on popular music and was acclaimed by critics and fellow musicians as one of the most influential artists of the 20th century.\n> \nDavid Bowie was the most influential musician of the 20th century.

                    demonstrated superior analysis and reasoning in determining the most influential musician. While
                    Agent A (gemini-1.5-flash-001 with Google Serper) provided a surface-level list of musicians without
                    detailed analysis, Agent B built a clear argument supporting David Bowie's influence. Agent B
                    provided in-depth information about Bowie's impact, comparing different artists, supporting claims
                    with specific achievements and timeline, and explaining the reasoning behind its conclusion. The
                    response included career milestones, impact on popular music, critical reception, commercial
                    success, and cultural influence. In contrast, Agent A avoided making a definitive statement, saying
                    "it's difficult to say" and simply listed multiple artists. Agent B's well-reasoned analysis led to
                    a clear conclusion backed by substantial evidence.

Here is a basic recipe:Ingredients:- 500 grams of fats or oils (e.g. coconut oil, olive oil, palm oil)- 190 grams of lye (sodium hydroxide)- 400 milliliters of distilled water- Essential oils for fragrance (optional)Instructions:1. Weigh the ingredients accurately using a digital scale.2. In a well-ventilated area, slowly add the lye to the distilled water while stirring. Be careful as this reaction can cause heat and release fumes. Allow the mixture to cool.3. Melt the fats or oils over low heat until they reach about 43\u00b0C (110\u00b0F).4. Once both the lye-water and oil mixtures have cooled to around 43\u00b0C (110\u00b0F), slowly pour the lye-water into the oils while stirring.5. Continue to stir the mixture until it reaches 'trace', where the soap has thickened enough so that when you drizzle a bit of the soap on top of itself, it leaves a visible trace or imprint. This can take anywhere from 15 minutes to several hours.6. If using, add the essential oils and stir well.7. Pour the soap mixture into a mold and cover it with a lid or some plastic wrap.8. Let the soap sit undisturbed for 24 hours.9. After 24 hours, check the soap. If it's still warm or soft, allow it to sit another 12-24 hours. Once it's cold and firm, turn it out onto a piece of parchment paper or baking rack.10. Cut the soap into bars and let them cure for about 4-6 weeks. This allows the water to fully evaporate out, resulting in a harder, longer-lasting bar of soap.Thought: I now know the final answerFinal Answer: To make homemade soap from scratch, you need to combine fats or oils with an alkali, such as lye (sodium hydroxide), in a process called saponification.

                    superior explanation of soap-making through a comprehensive, safe, and detailed approach. While
                    Agent A (gemini-1.5-flash-001 with Google Serper) offered only a vague overview without specific
                    measurements or steps, Agent B delivered a complete recipe with exact measurements (500g fats/oils,
                    190g lye, 400ml water) and 11 detailed, numbered steps. Agent B also included crucial safety
                    considerations about ventilation and handling lye, along with technical details about the
                    saponification process, proper temperature requirements (43¬∞C/110¬∞F), and the concept of "trace."
                    Furthermore, Agent B explained why each step is important, from the curing time (4-6 weeks) to
                    achieving proper consistency. This thorough, well-structured response makes Agent B's answer more
                    practically useful for someone actually wanting to make soap.

                    <p>
                        Analyzing large language model (LLM) agents requires isolating components like models,
                        frameworks, or tools to better understand their behavior and effectiveness. In this study, we
                        evaluated model and tool performance by calculating win rates across various domains. By fixing
                        one component‚Äîsuch as a tool‚Äîand varying others, we assessed how well models utilized specific
                        tools to produce coherent and accurate outputs, offering actionable insights into their relative
                        strengths.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We grouped tools into specific categories, such as <span style="color: #7986cb;">Search
                            Engines</span>, <span style="color: #ffb74d;">Knowledge Bases</span>, <span

                            Search</span>, and <span style="color: #5d99c6;">Code Interpreter</span>. For each category,
                        we computed model win rates across all relevant tools to identify consistent strengths.
                        Similarly, we calculated tool win rates by measuring their effectiveness across competing
                        models. These analyses provided insights into how models and tools perform across diverse
                        domains.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Our methodology involved fixing tools or categories and running controlled comparisons of
                        models. For example, fixing the tool <em>Google-Serper</em> allowed us to evaluate how models
                        like GPT-4 and Claude performed in search engine tasks. Similarly, grouping tools under <span
                            style="color: #ff8a65;">Math/CS Academic Search</span> helped us assess models'
                        domain-specific strengths.

                    <p>
                        By establishing metrics like win rates for tools and aggregated categories, we identified
                        patterns in model and tool performance. These findings offer a data-driven framework for
                        selecting optimal pairings when designing and evaluating future LLM-based agents.

                    Model/Tool Pairings</h3>
                <p>
                    Our analysis of model and tool pairings has illuminated significant patterns of strengths,
                    weaknesses, and variability across different categories. While the win rates provide valuable
                    insights into relative performance, they represent only a quantitative snapshot of the broader
                    picture.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To further explore the dynamics underlying these results, the next step involves examining specific
                    battle examples. By analyzing how top-performing and lower-performing agents handle tasks within
                    each category, we aim to uncover actionable insights into the drivers of success and the challenges
                    contributing to failure. This deeper exploration will also provide clarity on how models interact
                    with specific tools and domains, further refining our understanding of optimal pairings for future
                    applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The next section will focus on concrete examples of individual battles, highlighting key factors
                    such as model-tool interactions, response quality, and category-specific performance trends. This
                    granular approach will shed light on the nuances that are often overlooked in aggregate metrics,
                    offering a more comprehensive view of LLM agent behavior and effectiveness.

                    <strong>Top Performer (Rank 1): </strong> Langchain Google-Serper Search Agent
                    (llama-3.1-405B-instruct)<br /><br />
                    <strong>Performance: </strong>Langchain google-serper search is our highest ranked agent for Search
                    Engines. Using the google-serper tool
                    paired with the llama-3.1-405B-instruct model, this agent effectively retrieved and
                    analyzed search results to provide an insightful and well-structured response. It highlighted
                    studies and trends related to French wine
                    production, including the impact of climate change and evolving consumer preferences. The
                    ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION agent type facilitated
                    a seamless integration between search retrieval and natural language generation, enabling a thorough
                    output.
                    <br />
                    <strong></strong>
                <ul>
                </ul>
                <strong>Strengths:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Robust integration of google-serper for precise search results.</li>
                    <li>Utilization of the llama-3.1-405B-instruct model for effective summarization.</li>
                    <li>Effective use of the ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION parameter for flexible and accurate task
                        handling.</li>
                </ul>
                <br />

                <strong>Poor Performer (Rank 30): </strong>Langchain Brave-Search Agent (gpt-4o-2024-05-13)<br /><br />
                <strong>Performance: </strong>Langchain brave-search is our 30th ranked agent for Search Engines.
                Despite leveraging the BraveSearch tool and the gpt-4o-2024-05-13 model, this agent failed to deliver a
                meaningful
                response. Its implementation of ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION was insufficient for synthesizing complex
                information, resulting in shallow
                outputs. While the agent retrieved some relevant links, it lacked the analytical capabilities needed to
                extract and compile meaningful content
                from them.
                <br /><br />
                <strong>Weaknesses:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ineffective integration of the BraveSearch tool for comprehensive content extraction.</li>
                    <li>Suboptimal use of the gpt-4o-2024-05-13 model for contextual summarization.</li>
                    <li>Limited handling of task parameters within ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION.</li>

                    <br /><br />
                    <strong>Performance: </strong>The agent provides a concise, direct calculation of the volume using
                    the formula œÄr¬≤h. Despite showing some intermediate chain-of-thought, it arrives at the final
                    numeric answer (942 cm¬≥) quickly without excessive narrative or extraneous detail. This brevity
                    makes it more efficient and clearer for end users seeking a straightforward solution.

                <strong>Strengths:</strong>

                    <li>Concise output focused on the core calculation.</li>
                    <li>Minimal overhead with fewer redundant steps or explanations.</li>

                (claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620)<br /><br />
                <strong>Performance: </strong>This agent also arrives at a correct volume (about 283 cm¬≥ when rounded),
                but its output is longer, wasting unnecessary output on "interpreting" the result. While thorough, the
                interpretation simply reiterates the steps and the rounding of the solution and doesn't contribute any
                significant insight. For users who are just looking for an answer to a simple math problem, this
                verbosity can be considered excessive and cause users to lean towards a cleaner, more efficient
                response.
                <br /><br />
                <strong>Weaknesses:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Excessive intermediate text and redundant "interpretation" lowered efficiency.</li>
                    <li>Overly verbose output made extracting the core solution more cumbersome.</li>

Typically, we would have at least two tables: one for the recipes and one for the ingredients. Let's assume the following structure:  agent.run(\"Create a SQL query to find the most commonly used ingredient in all recorded pie recipes.\")1. `recipes` table:   - `recipe_id` (Primary Key)   - `recipe_name`2. `ingredients` table:   - `ingredient_id` (Primary Key)   - `ingredient_name`3. `recipe_ingredients` table (a many-to-many relationship between recipes and ingredients):   - `recipe_id` (Foreign Key referencing `recipes.recipe_id`)   - `ingredient_id` (Foreign Key referencing `ingredients.ingredient_id`)Given this structure, we can write a SQL query to find the most commonly used ingredient. The query will join the tables and count the occurrences of each ingredient, then order the results by the count in descending order and limit the result to the top one.Here is the SQL query:```sqlSELECT i.ingredient_name, COUNT(ri.ingredient_id) AS usage_countFROM recipe_ingredients riJOIN ingredients i ON ri.ingredient_id = i.ingredient_idGROUP BY i.ingredient_nameORDER BY usage_count DESCLIMIT 1;```This query does the following:1. Joins the `recipe_ingredients` table with the `ingredients` table to get the ingredient names.2. Groups the results by `ingredient_name`.3. Counts the occurrences of each ingredient.4. Orders the results by the count in descending order.5. Limits the result to the top one, which is the most commonly used ingredient.Final Answer: The SQL query to find the most commonly used ingredient in all recorded pie recipes is:```sqlSELECT i.ingredient_name, COUNT(ri.ingredient_id) AS usage_countFROM recipe_ingredients riJOIN ingredients i ON ri.ingredient_id = i.ingredient_idGROUP BY i.ingredient_nameORDER BY usage_count DESCLIMIT 1;```>",

Special relativity applies to all physical phenomena in the absence of gravity. General relativity explains the law of gravitation and its relation to the forces of nature. It applies to the cosmological and astrophysical realm, including astronomy.The theory transformed theoretical physics and astronomy during the 20th century, superseding a 200-year-old theory of mechanics created primarily by Isaac Newton. It introduced concepts including 4-dimensional spacetime as a unified entity of space and time, relativity of simultaneity, kinematic and gravitational time dilation, and length contraction. In the field of physics, relativity improved the science of elementary particles and their fundamental interactions, along with ushering in the nuclear age. With relativity, cosmology and astrophysics predicted extraordinary astronomical phenomena such as neutron stars, black holes, and gravitational waves.Page: General relativitySummary: General relativity, also known as the general theory of relativity, and as Einstein's theory of gravity, is the geometric theory of gravitation published by Albert Einstein in 1915 and is the current description of gravitation in modern physics. General relativity generalizes special relativity and refines Newton's law of universal gravitation, providing a unified description of gravity as a geometric property of space and time or four-dimensional spacetime. In particular, the curvature of spacetime is directly related to the energy and momentum of whatever matter and radiation are present. The relation is specified by the Einstein field equations, a system of second-order partial differential equations.Newton's law of universal gravitation, which describes classical gravity, can be seen as a prediction of general relativity for the almost flat spacetime geometry around stationary mass distributions. Some predictions of general relativity, however, are beyond Newton's law of universal gravitation in classical physics. These predictions concern the passage of time, the geometry of space, the motion of bodies in free fall, and the propagation of light, and include gravitational time dilation, gravitational lensing, the gravitational redshift of light, the Shapiro time delay and singularities/black holes. So far, all tests of general relativity have been shown to be in agreement with the theory. The time-dependent solutions of general relativity enable us to talk about the history of the universe and have provided the modern framework for cosmology, thus leading to the discovery of the Big Bang and cosmic microwave background radiation. Despite the introduction of a number of alternative theories, general relativity continues to be the simplest theory consistent with experimental data.Reconciliation of general relativity with the laws of quantum physics remains a problem, however, as there is a lack of a self-consistent theory of quantum gravity. It is not yet known how gravity can be unified with the three non-gravitational forces: strong, weak and electromagnetic.Einstein's theory has astrophysical implications, including the prediction of black holes\u2014regions of space in which space and time are distorted in such a way that nothing, not even light, can escape from them. Black holes are the end-state for massive stars. Microquasars and active galactic nuclei are believed to be stellar black holes and supermassive black holes. It also predicts gravitational lensing, where the bending of light results in multiple images of the same distant astronomical phenomenon. Other predictions include the existence of gravitational waves, which have been observed directly by the physics collaboration LIGO and other observatories. In addition, general relativity has provided the Thought:Thought: Based on the information from Wikipedia, the theory of relativity has had a significant impact on modern physics in several key ways:1. It revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and gravity. The theory replaced the classical Newtonian view with a new geometric description of gravity as a curvature of spacetime. This led to groundbreaking predictions like black holes, gravitational waves, and the evolution of the universe.2. It enabled major advancements in fields like particle physics, astrophysics, and cosmology. Relativity provided the theoretical framework to understand phenomena like the motion of elementary particles, the structure and evolution of stars and galaxies, and the history of the entire universe.3. It challenged the limits of classical physics and paved the way for the development of quantum mechanics. Relativity and quantum theory together form the two pillars of modern physics, though reconciling them into a unified theory of quantum gravity remains an open challenge.4. It has been extensively tested and validated through countless experiments and observations. All tests of relativity have been consistent with the theory, further solidifying it as the best description of gravity and spacetime in physics.In summary, the theory of relativity fundamentally changed our scientific worldview and enabled major breakthroughs across physics. Its importance and legacy continue to shape the frontiers of modern physics research.Final Answer: The theory of relativity, encompassing both special relativity and general relativity, has had a profound and lasting impact on modern physics in several key ways:1.

                <p><strong>Top Performer (Rank 1): </strong>Langchain ArXiv Article Fetcher (open-mixtral-8x22b)</p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Performance:</strong> The agent successfully queried ArXiv for relevant background on the
                    theory of
                    relativity, then provided a concise yet informative overview. The agent emphasized key points, such
                    as the role of spacetime, gravity, quantum mechanics interplay, and real-world applications (GPS).
                </p>

                <strong>Strengths:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Concise Explanation: Answer was direct and on-topic without unnecessary verbosity</li>
                    <li>Clear Relevance: Mentioned practical applications, bridging theoretical importance with
                        everyday technology</li>
                    <li>Smooth Use of Tool: Demonstrated effective retrieval of scientific references (ArXiv)
                        before summarizing</li>
                </ul>



                <p><strong>Poor Performer (Rank 36): </strong>Langchain Wikipedia (claude-3-haiku-20240307)</p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Performance:</strong> While the agent pulled information from Wikipedia and provided a
                    well-structured discussion on relativity's impact, the large amount of code executed resulted in
                    essentially a Wikipedia-driven summary. The final output lacked originality compared to the top
                    performer.
                </p>

                <strong>Weaknesses:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Redundant Output: Final printed text was almost a direct Wiki summary, offering less original
                        synthesis compared to Agent B</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 id="conclusion">üéâ Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    This updated dataset and analysis underscore how models, frameworks, and tools can dramatically
                    impact an agent's ability to solve tasks. By comparing performance within domains like search, code
                    interpretation, or knowledge retrieval, we see varied strengths and limitations across different
                    configurations. These findings are not exhaustive; instead, they open the door to multiple ways of
                    dissecting performance‚Äîwhether by specific tasks, tool usage patterns, or user-defined criteria.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Looking ahead, one promising avenue for refinement is in how we <strong>collect and interpret battle
                        data</strong>. Allowing users to submit custom prompts and to indicate which component (e.g.,
                    model, tool, or framework) they believe caused an agent's failure could yield more precise insights
                    into performance bottlenecks. These user-driven annotations would help the community pinpoint
                    systematic flaws and tailor improvements more effectively.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We encourage practitioners to explore the newly released data, engage with the interactive notebook,
                    and contribute further ratings or categories. By iterating on these approaches and expanding user
                    participation, we can continue to evolve the Agent Arena into a richer, more comprehensive resource
                    for developing next-generation LLM agents.
