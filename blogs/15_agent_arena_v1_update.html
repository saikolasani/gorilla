                        Since its release last month, the Agent Arena has gathered over <strong>500 new user-submitted
                            ratings</strong>, bringing our total to an impressive <strong>2,671 pairwise
                            comparisons</strong>. This expansion is particularly noteworthy üéâ as it permits the
                        publication of a <strong>new dataset of battle results</strong> in tandem with an updated
                        Elo-based rating system for evaluating agents.
                    </p>

                        As part of this update, we are also sharing an interactive notebook to aid users in exploring
                        these ratings and uncover deeper insights into our evolving rankings. You may access the new
                        battle dataset and the Elo calculation notebook here:

                        certain agents and their subcomponents continue to outperform others. By leveraging our newly
                        updated battle data, we delve into critical insights across several dimensions:

                            excel at agentic tasks? How do they contrast with lower-performing models like

A runaway version of the greenhouse effect can be defined by a limit on a planet's outgoing longwave radiation which is asymptotically reached due to higher surface temperatures evaporating water into the atmosphere, increasing its optical depth. This positive feedback means the planet cannot cool down through longwave radiation (via the Stefan\u2013Boltzmann law) and continues to heat up until it can radiate outside of the absorption bands of the water vapour.The runaway greenhouse effect is often formulated with water vapour as the condensable species. The water vapour reaches the stratosphere and escapes into space via hydrodynamic escape, resulting in a desiccated planet. This likely happened in the early history of Venus.Research in 2012 found that almost all lines of evidence indicate that it is unlikely to be possible to trigger a full runaway greenhouse on Earth by adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. However, the authors cautioned that \"our understanding of the dynamics, thermodynamics, radiative transfer and cloud physics of hot and steamy atmospheres is weak\", and that we \"cannot therefore completely rule out the possibility that human actions might cause a transition, if not to full runaway, then at least to a much warmer climate state than the present one\". A runaway greenhouse effect similar to Venus appears to have virtually no chance of being caused by people. A 2013 article concluded that runaway greenhouse \"could in theory be triggered by increased greenhouse forcing\", but that \"anthropogenic emissions are probably insufficient\". Venus-like conditions on Earth require a large long-term forcing that is unlikely to occur until the sun brightens by some tens of percents, which will take a few billion years. Earth is expected to experience a runaway greenhouse effect \"in about 2 billion years as solar luminosity increases\".Page: Greenhouse effectSummary: The greenhouse effect occurs when greenhouse gases in a planet's atmosphere insulate the planet from losing heat to space, raising its surface temperature. Surface heating can happen from an internal heat source as in the case of Jupiter, or from its host star as in the case of the Earth. In the case of Earth, the Sun emits shortwave radiation (sunlight) that passes through greenhouse gases to heat the Earth's surface. In response, the Earth's surface emits longwave radiation that is mostly absorbed by greenhouse gases. The absorption of longwave radiation prevents it from reaching space, reducing the rate at which the Earth can cool off.Without the greenhouse effect, the Earth's average surface temperature would be about \u221218 \u00b0C (\u22120.4 \u00b0F), compared to the 20th century average of about 14 \u00b0C (57 \u00b0F), or a more recent average of about 15 \u00b0C (59 \u00b0F). In addition to naturally present greenhouse gases, burning of fossil fuels has increased amounts of carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere. As a result, global warming of about 1.2 \u00b0C (2.2 \u00b0F) has occurred since the Industrial Revolution, with the global average surface temperature increasing at a rate of 0.18 \u00b0C (0.32 \u00b0F) per decade since 1981.All objects with a temperature above absolute zero emit thermal radiation. The wavelengths of thermal radiation emitted by the Sun and Earth differ because their surface temperatures are different. The Sun has a surface temperature of 5,500 \u00b0C (9,900 \u00b0F), so it emits most of its energy as shortwave radiation in near-infrared and visible wavelengths (as sunlight). In contrast, Earth's surface has a much lower temperature, so it emits longwave radiation at mid- and far-infrared wavelengths. A gas is a greenhouse gas if it absorbs longwave radiation. Earth's atmosphere absorbs only 23% Thought:Thought: I now have a better understanding of the greenhouse effect and its relationship with climate change. The greenhouse effect occurs when greenhouse gases in the atmosphere insulate the planet from losing heat to space, raising its surface temperature. Human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, have increased the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, leading to global warming.Action: wikipediaAction Input: Greenhouse gases and climate changeObservation: Page: Climate change mitigationSummary: Climate change mitigation (or decarbonisation) is action to limit the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere that cause climate change. Climate change mitigation actions include conserving energy and replacing fossil fuels with clean energy sources. Secondary mitigation strategies include changes to land use and removing carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere. Current climate change mitigation policies are insufficient as they would still result in global warming of about 2.7 \u00b0C by 2100, significantly above the 2015 Paris Agreement's goal of limiting global warming to below 2 \u00b0C.  Solar energy and wind power can replace fossil fuels at the lowest cost compared to other renewable energy options. The availability of sunshine and wind is variable and can require electrical grid upgrades, such as using long-distance electricity transmission to group a range of power sources. Energy storage can also be used to even out power output, and demand management can limit power use when power generation is low. Cleanly generated electricity can usually replace fossil fuels for powering transportation, heating buildings, and running industrial processes. Certain processes are more difficult to decarbonise, such as air travel and cement production. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) can be an option to reduce net emissions in these circumstances, although fossil fuel power plants with CCS technology is currently a high cost climate change mitigation strategy.Human land use changes such as agriculture and deforestation cause about 1/4th of climate change. These changes impact how much CO2 is absorbed by plant matter and how much organic matter decays or burns to release CO2. These changes are part of the fast carbon cycle, whereas fossil fuels release CO2 that was buried underground as part of the slow carbon cycle. Methane is a short lived greenhouse gas that is produced by decaying organic matter and livestock, as well as fossil fuel extraction. Land use changes can also impact precipitation patterns and the reflectivity of the surface of the Earth. It is possible to cut emissions from agriculture by reducing food waste, switching to a more plant-based diet (also referred to as low-carbon diet), and by improving farming processes.Various policies can encourage climate change mitigation. Carbon pricing systems have been set up that either tax CO2 emissions or cap total emissions and trade emission credits. Fossil fuel subsidies can be eliminated in favor of clean energy subsidies, and incentives offered for installing energy efficiency measures or switching to electric power sources. Another issue is overcoming environmental objections when constructing new clean energy sources and making grid modifications.Page: Climate changeSummary: In common usage, climate change describes global warming\u2014the ongoing increase in global average temperature\u2014and its effects on Earth's climate system. Climate change in a broader sense also includes previous long-term changes to Earth's climate. The current rise in global average temperature is primarily caused by humans burning fossil fuels since the Industrial Revolution. Fossil fuel use, deforestation, and some agricultural and industrial practices add to greenhouse gases. These gases absorb some of the heat that the Earth radiates after it warms from sunlight, warming the lower atmosphere. Carbon dioxide, the primary greenhouse gas driving global warming, has grown by about 50% and is at levels unseen for millions of years.Climate change has an increasingly large impact on the environment. Deserts are expanding, while heat waves and wildfires are becoming more common. Amplified warming in the Arctic has contributed to thawing permafrost, retreat of glaciers and sea ice decline.

Action: wikipediaAction Input: Greenhouse effect contribution to climate changeObservation: Page: Climate changeSummary: In common usage, climate change describes global warming\u2014the ongoing increase in global average temperature\u2014and its effects on Earth's climate system. Climate change in a broader sense also includes previous long-term changes to Earth's climate. The current rise in global average temperature is primarily caused by humans burning fossil fuels since the Industrial Revolution. Fossil fuel use, deforestation, and some agricultural and industrial practices add to greenhouse gases. These gases absorb some of the heat that the Earth radiates after it warms from sunlight, warming the lower atmosphere. Carbon dioxide, the primary greenhouse gas driving global warming, has grown by about 50% and is at levels unseen for millions of years.Climate change has an increasingly large impact on the environment. Deserts are expanding, while heat waves and wildfires are becoming more common. Amplified warming in the Arctic has contributed to thawing permafrost, retreat of glaciers and sea ice decline. Higher temperatures are also causing more intense storms, droughts, and other weather extremes. Rapid environmental change in mountains, coral reefs, and the Arctic is forcing many species to relocate or become extinct. Even if efforts to minimize future warming are successful, some effects will continue for centuries. These include ocean heating, ocean acidification and sea level rise.Climate change threatens people with increased flooding, extreme heat, increased food and water scarcity, more disease, and economic loss. Human migration and conflict can also be a result. The World Health Organization calls climate change one of the biggest threats to global health in the 21st century. Societies and ecosystems will experience more severe risks without action to limit warming. Adapting to climate change through efforts like flood control measures or drought-resistant crops partially reduces climate change risks, although some limits to adaptation have already been reached. Poorer communities are responsible for a small share of global emissions, yet have the least ability to adapt and are most vulnerable to climate change.Many climate change impacts have been felt in recent years, with 2023 the warmest on record at +1.48 \u00b0C (2.66 \u00b0F) since regular tracking began in 1850. Additional warming will increase these impacts and can trigger tipping points, such as melting all of the Greenland ice sheet. Under the 2015 Paris Agreement, nations collectively agreed to keep warming \"well under 2 \u00b0C\". However, with pledges made under the Agreement, global warming would still reach about 2.7 \u00b0C (4.9 \u00b0F) by the end of the century. Limiting warming to 1.5 \u00b0C would require halving emissions by 2030 and achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.Fossil fuel use can be phased out by conserving energy and switching to energy sources that do not produce significant carbon pollution. These energy sources include wind, solar, hydro, and nuclear power. Cleanly generated electricity can replace fossil fuels for powering transportation, heating buildings, and running industrial processes. Carbon can also be removed from the atmosphere, for instance by increasing forest cover and farming with methods that capture carbon in soil.Page: History of climate change scienceSummary: The history of the scientific discovery of climate change began in the early 19th century when ice ages and other natural changes in paleoclimate were first suspected and the natural greenhouse effect was first identified. In the late 19th century, scientists first argued that human emissions of greenhouse gases could change Earth's energy balance and climate. The existence of the greenhouse effect, while not named as such, was proposed as early as 1824 by Joseph Fourier. The argument and the evidence were further strengthened by Claude Pouillet in 1827 and 1838. In 1856 Eunice Newton Foote demonstrated that the warming effect of the sun is greater for air with water vapour Thought:Thought: I now know the final answerFinal Answer: The greenhouse effect contributes to climate change by trapping heat in the atmosphere, leading to an increase in global average temperature. Human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, have increased the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, leading to global warming. The greenhouse effect is a natural process that occurs when greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, absorb longwave radiation from the Earth's surface and atmosphere, preventing it from escaping into space. This process is essential for life on Earth, as it keeps the planet warm enough to support life. However, human activities have increased the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, leading to an enhancement of the natural greenhouse effect and an increase in global temperatures. Climate change has severe impacts on the environment, including rising sea levels, more frequent natural disasters, and changes in weather patterns. To mitigate climate change, it is essential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by transitioning to renewable energy sources, increasing energy efficiency, and implementing policies to limit emissions.> The greenhouse effect contributes to climate change by trapping heat in the atmosphere, leading to an increase in global average temperature.

                    a very brief, surface-level explanation, while Agent B offered a comprehensive explanation covering
                    multiple aspects: the basic mechanism of the greenhouse effect, the natural vs enhanced greenhouse
                    effect, human activities' impact, specific consequences like sea levels and weather patterns, and
                    mitigation strategies. üß† Agent B included specific technical details such as the distinction
                    between longwave and shortwave radiation, multiple greenhouse gases like CO2 and methane, and
                    current mitigation approaches. üìö Furthermore, Agent B provided a well-structured response that
                    flowed logically from the basic mechanism to human impact, consequences, and solutions. üîç Agent B
                    demonstrated a more thorough research process, making multiple Wikipedia queries to build a
                    comprehensive understanding, whereas Agent A made a single search query and provided that
                    information directly. In this case, llama-3.1-70B-instruct combined with Wikipedia as a knowledge
                    base produced a more educational, scientifically accurate, and complete response compared to the

A PPF illustrates several economic concepts, such as allocative efficiency, economies of scale, opportunity cost (or marginal rate of transformation), productive efficiency,  and scarcity of resources (the fundamental economic problem that all societies face). This tradeoff is usually considered for an economy, but also applies to each individual, household, and economic organization. One good can only be produced by diverting resources from other goods, and so by producing less of them.The code that caused this warning is on line 389 of the file /opt/render/project/src/.venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/wikipedia/wikipedia.py. To get rid of this warning, pass the additional argument 'features=\"lxml\"' to the BeautifulSoup constructor.Graphically bounding the production set for fixed input quantities, the PPF curve shows the maximum possible production level of one commodity for any given production level of the other, given the existing state of technology. By doing so, it defines productive efficiency in the context of that production set: a point on the frontier indicates efficient use of the available inputs (such as points B, D and C in the graph), a point beneath the curve (such as A) indicates inefficiency, and a point beyond the curve (such as X) indicates impossibility.  lis = BeautifulSoup(html).find_all('li')PPFs are normally drawn as bulging upwards or outwards from the origin (\"concave\" when viewed from the origin), but they can be represented as bulging downward (inwards) or linear (straight), depending on a number of assumptions. An outward shift of the PPC results from growth of the availability of inputs, such as physical capital or labour, or from technological progress in knowledge of how to transform inputs into outputs. Such a shift reflects, for instance, economic growth of an economy already operating at its full productivity (on the PPF), which means that more of both outputs can now be produced during the specified period of time without sacrificing the output of either good. Conversely, the PPF will shift inward if the labour force shrinks, the supply of raw materials is depleted, or a natural disaster decreases the stock of physical capital.However, most economic contractions reflect not that less can be produced but that the economy has started operating below the frontier, as typically, both labour and physical capital are underemployed, remaining therefore idle.In microeconomics, the PPF shows the options open to an individual, household, or firm in a two-good world. By definition, each point on the curve is productively efficient, but, given the nature of market demand, some points will be more profitable than others. Equilibrium for a firm will be the combination of outputs on the PPF that is most profitable.From a macroeconomic perspective, the PPF illustrates the production possibilities available to Thought:Thought: I have found relevant information on opportunity cost, but I need to understand it better.Action: wikipediaAction Input: Opportunity costObservation: Page: Opportunity costSummary: In microeconomic theory, the opportunity cost of a choice is the value of the best alternative forgone where, given limited resources, a choice needs to be made between several mutually exclusive alternatives.

                    üåü <strong>Outcome:</strong> In this comparison, Agent A (llama-3.1-70B-instruct with Wikipedia)
                    provided a more detailed and structured explanation of opportunity cost, covering both theoretical
                    and practical aspects. Agent B (gpt-4o-2024-08-06 with Google Serper) offered a concise definition
                    but lacked depth in exploring the implications and applications of the concept. üìö Agent A's use of
                    Wikipedia allowed for a broader exploration of related economic principles, making it more
                    informative for users seeking comprehensive understanding. üîç

                <h2 id="analysis-of-frameworks">üîß Analysis of Frameworks</h2>
                <p>
                    Beyond mere model design, the <strong>framework</strong> chosen‚Äîsuch as <em>LangChain</em>,
                    <em>LlamaIndex</em>, <em>CrewAI</em>, or <em>OpenAI Assistants</em>‚Äîsignificantly shapes an agent's
                    robustness and complexity handling. Our results reinforce that <em>LlamaIndex</em> is consistently
                    competitive in structured data settings, while <em>OpenAI Assistants</em> often lag behind on tasks
                    demanding multiple interaction steps.
                </p>

                <h4>Top-Performing Framework: LlamaIndex (ELO: 1086.73)</h4>

                        across data pipelines, including parallelization for large-scale tasks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cross-Domain Reliability:</strong> Successfully tackles challenges in both technical
                        (e.g., ArXiv research) and practical (e.g., flight search) domains, leveraging robust retrieval
                        structures.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Worst-Performing Framework: OpenAI Assistants (ELO: 943.28)</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Generic Answers:</strong> Often defaults to surface-level content when encountering
                        specialized tasks or unique domains ü§®.</li>
                    <li><strong>Inadequate Error Recovery:</strong> Lacks mechanisms to gracefully handle runtime or
                        integration disruptions, yielding incomplete results.</li>
                    <li><strong>Insufficient Specialization:</strong> Proves less effective on multi-step or heavily
                        contextual queries, delivering broad guidance rather than detail-rich outputs.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 id="domain-specific-insights">üåê Domain-Specific Insights</h2>
                <p>
                    By tagging and categorizing battles based on domains (finance, education, medical, etc.), the Agent
                    Arena reveals patterns that go beyond simple Elo values. Key highlights include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Llama-70B + LangChain</strong> emerges as a strong pair in research-centric and
                        data-intensive tasks, achieving an ~85% win rate.</li>
                    <li><strong>Open-Mixtral-8x7B + Google-Serper</strong> excels at summarization or rapid knowledge
                        synthesis, consistently surpassing ~88% success in retrieval-driven scenarios.</li>
                    <li><strong>Gemini-1.5-Pro-002</strong> surprisingly demonstrates a ~75% success rate in code
                        interpreter tasks, underscoring that even lower-ranked models may thrive in specific niches.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Limiting the battles to a particular tool or domain offers detailed insights into each model's
                    strengths. Such analyses often showcase hidden capabilities, guiding developers in strategically
                    pairing models with the tools that best complement their skill sets.
                </p>
                <h4>Complementary vs. Competitive Interactions ü§ù</h4>
                <p>
                    Intriguingly, certain agents converge on the same correct answer using different logical routes,
                    underscoring the flexibility of large language models in problem-solving. Conversely, significant
                    disagreements frequently underscore the edge held by an agent with more rigorous, evidence-based
                    reasoning. Studying "disagreement prompts" has proven invaluable in refining chain-of-thought
                    strategies.
